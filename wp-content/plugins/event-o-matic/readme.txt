Manage submissions to build a community-driven event listing. Allow users to submit events that you can easily review and moderate.

== Description ==

The Event-O-Matic is a snappy little plugin that allows quick publishing of event listings on your website. Unlike other event plugins, Event-O-Matic allows your users to submit their own events and gives you the ability to moderate these events as they arrive to your site. Edit or reject submitted events and add them to your listings for the ultimate social driven event service. Event-O-Matic is also fully integrated with Google Maps to give each event clear location information within your city.

Other features:

 * Easy media upload for events.
 * Sidebar widget with upcoming events listings.
 * Admin Dashboard pane for quick status previews.
 * Admin Bar integration.
 * Updated Google Maps Geolocation service for instant validation of address information.

== Screenshots ==
1. Quickly add moderate venues and events with the Event-O-Matic admin panel.

The event listing page contains several classes that allow you to set styles within your own stylesheet. the main event listings page contains an unordered list with eom_events_list class.
